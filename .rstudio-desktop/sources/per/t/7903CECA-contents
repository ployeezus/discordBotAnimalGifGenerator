## The data

What does the distribution of housefly wing lengths (in mm) look like? This was apparently an important question in 1955, and the data set we look at is a famous one, from Sokal & Hunter, reproduced here:

https://seattlecentral.edu/qelp/sets/057/057.html

The data set can be scanned in from the web:

```{r}
wings <- scan("wings.txt")
```

This reads the data in as a vector.

## Summary statistics

Find the sample mean:

```{r}
wings <- scan("wings.txt")
mean <- mean(wings)
mean
```

The sample mean fly wing length is 45.5 millimeters.

Find the plug-in standard deviation and the sample standard deviation:

```{r}
# Plug-in
sd <- sqrt(mean(wings^2) - mean(wings)^2)
sd
# Sample SD
sd(wings)
```

There's hardly any difference. To one decimal place, the standard deviation of fly wing lengths is 3.9 millimeters.

We can also describe the data using the five-number summary:

```{r}
summary <- summary(wings)
summary
```

The median fly wing length is 45.5 millimeters. The interquartile range is 5 millimeters.



## Plot the data

Plot the empirical CDF, adding labels:

```{r}
plot(ecdf(wings), main = "ECDF of housefly wing lengths",
     xlab = "Wing length (mm)", ylab = "Empirical CDF")
```

Draw a well-labeled frequency histogram, using bins of width 1 mm:

```{r}
hist(wings, breaks = 35.5:55.5, main = "Frequency histogram of housefly wing lengths",
     xlab = "Wing length (mm)")
```

Draw a kernel density plot:

```{r}
plot(density(wings), main = "Kernel density plot of housefly wing lengths",
     xlab = "Wing length (mm)")
```

Draw a boxplot:

```{r}
boxplot(wings, main = "Boxplot of housefly wing lengths",
        ylab = "Wing length (mm)")
```

Draw a normal quantile-quantile plot:

```{r}
qqnorm(wings, main = "Normal QQ plot of housefly wing lengths")
```

Does the data look like it follows a normal distribution, apart from small discrepancies like rounding? Yes

There's one thing about the data that might make one suspicious that the data is made up. The suspicious thing is: The negative quantiles

```{r}
a <- 2 * (1 - pbinom(267, 500, 0.5))
a
```
